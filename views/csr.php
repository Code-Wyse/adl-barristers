            <p>At Cloth Fair Chambers we are committed to supporting causes that foster the education and advancement of young people, especially those who aspire to be criminal barristers. Providing both financial and practical support, we take our social responsibilities seriously and pay particular attention to raising aspirations and providing opportunities for young people from less-advantaged backgrounds.  This mission is necessarily linked to the critical need for diversity and inclusion, and breaking down barriers in the profession.</p>
			<p>Our members regularly provide mentoring and advocacy training to aspiring lawyers.  Furthermore, we are proud to sponsor specific causes, examples of which are here:</p>

    <p style="display:none;">Cloth Fair Chambers provides financial sponsorship to one eligible student who has completed their education in a non-fee-paying school based in the approximate locality around Chambers, and who is studying Law at third level. This sponsorship will last the duration of the student’s law degree, providing financial support and security in order to allow them to reach their fullest potential while developing their advocacy skills. In addition to the provision of financial support from Chambers, the student will also be offered the opportunity to complete work experience arranged by Chambers.</p>
